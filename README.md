# Overview

The goal for this simple Hello World project is primarily to create a template to use with my future projects as I officially start creating my software portfolio. I also want to have something to use to demonstrate basic functionality like Visual Studio Code, Github, and Python operation.

My plan is to use the next 14 weeks to create 6 projects for my software portfolio, and this simple Hello World program is the template I will use for each of those projects. My goal for each of the projects is to create a minimum viable product for each project, and then after I have gotten that produced, I will add more as time permits. The projects I will complete are as follows

* Task Manager (console based)
* Health and Fitness App
* Personal Finance Manager
* Stock Market Analysis
* Weather Radar Map
* Student Records
